Notes

Program Boilerplate

The public class name has to correspond to the name of the file that contains the course code:

Example.java

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Text to be printed");
    }
}

Execution of the program starts from the line that follows public static void main(String[] args) {, and ends at the closing curly bracket }
