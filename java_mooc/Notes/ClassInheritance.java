/* Class Inheritance */

/*Classes are used to clarify the concepts of the problem domain in
object-oriented programming. Every class we create adds functionality to the
programming language. This functionality is needed to solve the problems that
we encounter. An essential idea behind object-oriented programming is that
solutions rise from the interactions between objects which are created from
classes. An object in object-oriented programming is an independent unit that
has a state, which can be modified by using the methods that the object
provides. Objects are used in cooperation; each has its own area of
responsibility. For instance, our user interface classes have so far made use
of Scanner objects.

Every Java class extends the class Object, which means that every class we
create has at its disposal all the methods defined in the Object class. If we
want to change how these methods are defined in Object function, they must be
overriden by defining a new implementation for them in the newly created class.
The objects we create receive the methods equals and hashCode, among others,
from the Object class.

Every class derives from Object, but it's also possible to derive from other
classes. When we examine the API (Application Programming Interface) of Java's
ArrayList, we notice that ArrayList has the superclass AbstractList.
AbstractList, in turn, has the class Object as its superclass.*/

  java.lang.Object
  java.util.AbstractCollection<E>
    java.util.AbstractList<E>
       java.util.ArrayList<E>

/*Each class can directly extend only one class. However, a class indirectly
inherits all the properties of the classes it extends. So the ArrayList class
derives from the class AbstractList, and indirectly derives from the classes
AbstractCollection and Object. So ArrayList has at its disposal all the
variables and methods of the classes AbstractList, AbstractCollection, and
Object.

You use the keyword extends to inherit the properties of a class. The class that
receives the properties is called the subclass, and the class whose properties
are inherited is called the superclass.

Let's take a look at a car manufacturing system that manages car parts. A basic
component of part management is the class Part, which defines the identifier,
the manufacturer, and the description.*/

public class Part {

    private String identifier;
    private String manufacturer;
    private String description;

    public Part(String identifier, String manufacturer, String description) {
        this.identifier = identifier;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getIdentifier() {
        return identifier;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public String getManufacturer() {
        return manufacturer;
    }
}

/*One part of the car is the engine. As is the case with all parts, the engine,
too, has a manufacturer, an identifier, and a description. In addition, each
engine has a type: for instance, an internal combustion engine, an electric
motor, or a hybrid engine.

The traditional way to implement the class Engine, without using inheritance,
would be this.*/

public class Engine {

    private String engineType;
    private String identifier;
    private String manufacturer;
    private String description;

    public Engine(String engineType, String identifier, String manufacturer, String description) {
        this.engineType = engineType;
        this.identifier = identifier;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getEngineType() {
        return engineType;
    }

    public String getIdentifier() {
        return identifier;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public String getManufacturer() {
        return manufacturer;
    }
}

/*We notice a significant amount of overlap between the contents of Engine and
Part. It can confidently be said the Engine is a special case of Part. The
Engine is a Part, but it also has properties that a Part does not have, which
in this case means the engine type.

Let's recreate the class Engine and, this time, use inheritance in our
implementation. We'll create the class Engine which inherits the class Part: an
engine is a special case of a part.*/

public class Engine extends Part {

    private String engineType;

    public Engine(String engineType, String identifier, String manufacturer, String description) {
        super(identifier, manufacturer, description);
        this.engineType = engineType;
    }

    public String getEngineType() {
        return engineType;
    }
}

/*The class definition public class Engine extends Part indicates that the class
Engine inherits the functionality of the class Part. We also define an object
variable engineType in the class Engine.

The constructor of the Engine class is worth some consideration. On its first
line we use the keyword super to call the constructor of the superclass. The
call super(identifier, manufacturer, description) calls the constructor public
Part(String identifier, String manufacturer, String description) which is
defined in the class Part. Through this process the object variables defined in
the superclass are initiated with their initial values. After calling the
superclass constructor, we also set the proper value for the object variable
engineType.

The super call bears some resemblance to the this call in a constructor; this is
used to call a constructor of this class, while super is used to call a
constructor of the superclass. If a constructor uses the constructor of the
superclass by calling super in it, the super call must be on the first line of
the constructor. This is similar to the case with calling this (must also be
the first line of the constructor).

Since the class Engine extends the class Part, it has at its disposal all the
methods that the class Part offers. You can create instances of the class
Engine the same way you can of any other class.*/

Engine engine = new Engine("combustion", "hz", "volkswagen", "VW GOLF 1L 86-91");
System.out.println(engine.getEngineType());
System.out.println(engine.getManufacturer());
// Sample output
// combustion
// volkswagen

/*As you can see, the class Engine has all the methods that are defined in the
class Part.*/
